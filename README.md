# I-am-Feeling-Lucky
Whenever I search a topic on Google, I don’t look at just one search result at a time. By middle-clicking a search result link (or clicking while hold- ing ctrl), I open the first several links in a bunch of new tabs to read later. I search Google often enough that this workflow—opening my browser, searching for a topic, and middle-clicking several links one by one—is tedious. It would be nice if I could simply type a search term on the com- mand line and have my computer automatically open a browser with all the top search results in new tabs.
this script does exactly that.

This is what your program does:
- Gets search keywords from the command line arguments.
- Retrieves the search results page.
- Opens a browser tab for each result.
